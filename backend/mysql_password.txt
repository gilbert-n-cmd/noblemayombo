Please create a MySQL user with a password and update the PHP files accordingly. For example, you can create a user with:

CREATE USER 'kalia_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON kalia_hospital_db.* TO 'kalia_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Then update the PHP files with:
$username = "kalia_user";
$password = "your_secure_password";

Replace 'your_secure_password' with a strong password of your choice.
